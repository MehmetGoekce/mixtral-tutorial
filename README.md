A comprehensive guide to using the Mixtral-7B language model with open-source tools and libraries.

## Overview

This repository contains tutorials, code examples, and Jupyter notebooks for working with Mistral AI's Mixtral-7B-v0.1 model. All implementations use open-source libraries and are designed to run on consumer hardware without requiring paid cloud services.

## Features

- **Zero Cost**: All examples use open-source libraries and tools
- **Practical Applications**: Ready-to-use code for real-world tasks
- **Resource-Efficient**: Techniques to run large models on limited hardware
- **Comprehensive Tutorials**: From basics to advanced techniques

## Notebooks

1. **Loading Mixtral-7B**: Efficient loading with quantization
2. **Text Generation**: Basic text generation with different parameters
3. **QA System**: Simple question-answering implementation
4. **Document Retrieval**: Retrieval-augmented generation system
5. **Model Fine-tuning**: Fine-tuning using PEFT and LoRA
6. **Web Interface**: Simple web UI using Gradio
7. **Advanced Context**: Conversation memory and context management
8. **Model Evaluation**: Performance evaluation on various tasks
9. **Deployment**: Serving the model via an API and batch processing
